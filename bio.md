			My name is Ben Black.  As a hobby, I like to play the drums and have been doing so for over 28 years.  I am into hiking and camping, doing outdoorsy things as well as watching/playing sports.  I have a 4 year old daughter that I like to spend time with/share in these adventures with.  I do have a bit of a nerdy side as well and like to dabble in making video games.  I enjoy video games, but also play such games as Magic the Gathering and D & D.

				<h2>Programming Background</h2>
				1.  I've programmed a few games in game maker language.  Those were by far the most fun that I've had as a programmer.

				2.  For work we had an engineering offsite teambuilding exercise, where we programmed a Lego robot to maneuver itself through a maze, and find an object and maneuver itself back to the start.  It was also very fun.
